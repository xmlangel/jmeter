docker-jmeter
=============

Ubuntu 14.04, Oracle JDK 8 and Tomcat 8 based docker container.

# Description
You should run this container on the background and mount the volume with your web app inside.

Includes:

 - Oracle JDK 1.8.120
 - Jmeter 3.0
 - Git, wget, curl, build-essential
 
## Volumes
Exports a volume on `/opt/jmeter/testcase`.
You can mount the volume on run to a local directory containing your war file or exploded war directory.
If you need the management app, remember to have a copy on your hosts volume mount point.

# How to run the container
## Using docker
You need docker v1.3+ installed. To get the container up and running, run:
 
```
sudo docker run -d -v /opt/jmeter/testcase:/opt/jmeter/testcase whatap/jmeter
docker run --rm -v /Users/Kwangmyung/kmdata/working/docker/apm/git/whatap-jmeter/testcase:/opt/jmeter/testcase --name jmeter whatap/jmeter ./jmeter -n -t ../testcase/First.bshrc
```
Remember to change `/opt/tomcat/webapps` to the directory where your app is stored.

## Using docker compose
If you have `docker-compose` installed, you can just launch:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```
